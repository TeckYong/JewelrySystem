Chan Chun Weng - He had populated all the customers data into a list to the system that include customer name, customer id, customer 
                 tel no, customer address from the query. And today he will create a buying operations for staff user so that as a staff 
                 role, the staff can sell the products to selected customer. Didn't meet any problem.





Yashua Daniel - Yesterday he ran a few unit tests on features for payment module. Then today he will start designing the sub system of
                payment module involving selling items. Didn't meet any problem so far.






Tan Jun Lem  - He fixed the coding errors for the add new customer's form on yesterday. And now the system should able to add new customer
               into the system. Jun Lem will start designing the system that would allow the staff update or edit the existing customer
               details such as contact number, address and so on. The problem he met is currently in the system doesn't have any existing
               customer details yet. So i would suggest him to key in some dummy data into the system and he can start debug,
